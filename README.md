# Flappy Bird Clone

This project is a Java Swing-based Flappy Bird clone that I developed using my knowledge of Swing, guidance from YouTube tutorials, and help from ChatGPT.

## Features

- **Classic Gameplay:**  
  A simplified version of the Flappy Bird game featuring a moving bird, obstacles (pipes), and collision detection.

- **Game Controls:**  
  - **Start Game:**  
    Press the **SPACE BAR** or click the **Play** button to start the game.
  - **Pause/Resume Game:**  
    Press the **Q** key or click the **Pause** button to pause the game. When paused, an overlay appears displaying "Paused" and "Press Q to continue game", along with a visual change (the pause button turns red).
  - **Replay:**  
    After a game over, the game displays your score and a **Replay** button to restart the game.

- **Scoring:**  
  The game keeps track of your score as you pass pipes.

- **Visual Enhancements:**  
  Custom images for the background, bird, and pipes are used. The game also includes overlay messages and color changes during pause to improve user feedback.

## Project Structure

- **Flappybird.java:**  
  Contains all the game logic including drawing, collision detection, and managing game state and UI overlays.

- **App.java:**  
  Serves as the entry point to launch the game. It sets up the main JFrame and adds the Flappybird panel.
